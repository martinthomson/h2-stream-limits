1.  Introduction

   HTTP/2 [HTTP/2] allows endpoints to describe a concurrency limit for
   streams (SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS).  Initially, the stream
   concurrency limit is only bounded by the maximum number of streams
   that can be created, which is 2^30 for each endpoint, but the value
   can be changed at any time.  Most endpoints set a smaller value in an
   attempt to protect the resources that are committed when processing a
   stream.

   This limit is not effective in the case that streams are quickly
   cancelled.  Stream cancellation with the RST_STREAM frame has
   immediate effect, which means that the stream no longer counts
   against the concurrent stream limit.  This means that a malicious
   endpoint can create and cancel an unbounded number of streams as long
   as its peer does not set a limit of zero.

   If the creation of the stream results in the expenditure of
   resources, rapidly creating and cancelling streams can exhaust
   resources.  For a server, clients that create and cancel many
   requests can effectively deny service; for a client, reserving and
   cancelling promised streams might have similar effect if a client
   does not disable server push using the SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH setting.
   This creates a denial of service exposure for which a remedy is not
   supported in the protocol.

   However, as noted in Section 10.5 of [HTTP/2], many of the features
   in HTTP/2 that have some potential to create denial of service
   attacks also have constructive uses.  Distinguishing constructive and
   destructive uses is often challenging.  Some applications of HTTP
   might find that cancelling many requests is necessary; if
   cancellation is treated as abusive, it is possible that the treatment
   necessary to prevent attacks might unintentionally punish some
   clients.

   In HTTP/3 [HTTP/3], the QUIC protocol it is built [QUIC] contains an
   alternative mechanism for limiting concurrency.  The scheme in QUIC,
   as described in Section 4.6 of [QUIC], does not set a concurrent
   stream limit, but instead relies on a peer increasing the maximum
   allowed stream identifier.  An endpoint cannot create new streams
   immediately after cancelling an open stream; their peer needs to send
   a message to make more streams available.  In QUIC therefore, a
   malicious endpoint can only create and cancel a finite number of
   streams, after which their peer needs to provide consent to continue.

   This document ports the QUIC stream concurrency limit mechanisms to
   HTTP/2.  As use of this system is voluntary and therefore not
   necessarily guaranteed, this does not prevent abusive use of stream
   cancellation.  However, deployment of this mechanism in popular
   implementations might allow endpoints to deploy more aggressive
   strategies for managing abuse in its absence.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The HTTP/2 MAX_STREAMS Frame

   The MAX_STREAMS frame (type=0xTBD) is used to limit the streams that
   a recipient is permitted to create.

   The format of the MAX_STREAMS frame is illustrated in Figure 1, using
   the notation defined in Section 1.3 of [QUIC].

   MAX_STREAMS Frame {
     Length (24) = 0x04,
     Type (8) = 0x0TBD,

     Unused Flags (8),

     Reserved (1),
     Stream Identifier (31) = 0,

     Reserved (1),
     Maximum Stream Identifier (31),
   }

                     Figure 1: MAX_STREAMS Frame Format

   In addition to the common HTTP/2 frame header (see Section 4 of
   [HTTP/2]), the MAX_STREAMS contains a one-bit reserved field and a
   31-bit Maxmimum Stream Identifier field.

   The Reserved field MUST be set to zero when sending and ignored on
   receipt.

   The Maximum Stream Identifier field contains the maximum value that a
   stream identifier can use when the recipient of this frame creates or
   reserves a stream; see Section 5.1 of [HTTP/2] for how streams are
   created.

   A MAX_STREAMS frame MUST be sent on stream 0.  Receipt of a
   MAX_STREAMS frame on any other stream MUST be treated as a connection
   error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR; see Section 5.4.1 of [HTTP/2].

   An endpoint MUST treat receipt of a MAX_STREAMS frame with a length
   other than 4 as a connection error of type FRAME_TYPE_ERROR; see
   Section 5.4.1 of [HTTP/2].

   A client MUST treat receipt of an odd-numbered Maximum Stream
   Identifier as a connection error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR; see
   Section 5.4.1 of [HTTP/2].  Similarly, a server MUST treat receipt of
   an even-numbered Maximum Stream Identifier as a connection error,
   with an exception of a value of 0, which can be used to indicate
   support for the feature without enabling the creation of streams (see
   Section 3.2).

3.1.  Applying Stream Limits

   An endpoint that receives a MAX_STREAMS frame MUST NOT create or
   reserve a stream with a number that exceeds the value of the Maximum
   Stream Identifier field from that frame, until it receives a
   MAX_STREAMS frame with a larger value.

   An endpoint MUST treat the creation or reservation of a stream with a
   higher valued stream identifier than it included in a MAX_STREAMS
   frame as a connection error of type FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR; see
   Section 5.4.1 of [HTTP/2].

   Endpoints can only increase the value that they include in a
   MAX_STREAMS frame.  An endpoint MUST treat receipt of a Maximum
   Stream Identifier that is equal to or smaller than a value that it
   has previously received as a connection error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR;
   see Section 5.4.1 of [HTTP/2].  Note that a value of 0, which can be
   used to indicate support for this feature (see Section 3.2) without
   permitting the creation of streams, is permitted for both client and
   server.

   An implementation can support a similar concurrency limit to that
   provided by SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS.  The initial value can
   be set to twice the value of SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS, with a
   client adding 1 if the value is non-zero.  The endpoint then
   increases the value of the Maximum Stream Identifier field as the
   streams its peer initiates are closed.  An endpoint can avoid sending
   redundant MAX_STREAMS frames by processing all incoming data before
   increasing the maximum.  This approach differs from
   SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS in that a peer is not able to create
   and cancel streams arbitrarily, as new streams do not become
   available until after receiving a MAX_STREAMS frame.

3.2.  Negotiating MAX_STREAMS Usage

   This extension is not negotiated using the SETTINGS frame.  Instead,
   the receipt of a MAX_STREAMS frame indicates support for the feature.

   An endpoint that supports this extension MUST send a MAX_STREAMS
   frame after establishing a connection, after the HTTP/2 connection
   preface (Section 3.4 of [HTTP/2]).  When a MAX_STREAMS frame is
   received, the endpoint MUST subsequently only create streams
   according to the rules in Section 3.1 and ignore any value of the
   SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS setting.

4.  Security Considerations

   HTTP/2 considered the cancellation of a stream to reclaim the
   resources that might have been committed during its creation.  The
   stream limits in HTTP/2 therefore did not provide a means to limit
   stream creation.  Though cancellation is a potential source of
   abusive traffic, it was not explicitly mentioned (see Section 10.5 of
   [HTTP/2]).  However, experience has shown that the creation of a
   stream has costs that cannot always be recovered when that stream is
   cancelled.

   The use of the MAX_STREAMS frame provides endpoints with a means of
   limiting stream creation, using a method that has proven to be
   effective in QUIC.  However, repeated use of the MAX_STREAMS frame is
   also a potential source of abuse, as described in Section 10.5 of
   [HTTP/2].  Though processing a MAX_STREAMS frame is likely to be
   trivial, receiving significantly more MAX_STREAMS frames than the
   number of streams that have been closed might indicate an attempt to
   waste effort.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a new entry in the "HTTP/2 Frame Type"
   registry, as documented in Section 11 of [HTTP/2].  This entry has
   the following values.

   Frame Type:  MAX_STREAMS

   Code:  0xTBD

   Specification:  Section 3
